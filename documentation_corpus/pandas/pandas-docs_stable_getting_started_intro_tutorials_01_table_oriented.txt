What kind of data does pandas handle?
#
I want to start using pandas
In [1]:
import
pandas
as
pd
To load the pandas package and start working with it, import the
package. The community agreed alias for pandas is
pd
, so loading
pandas as
pd
is assumed standard practice for all of the pandas
documentation.
pandas data table representation
#
I want to store passenger data of the Titanic. For a number of passengers, I know the name (characters), age (integers) and sex (male/female) data.
In [2]:
df
=
pd
.
DataFrame
(
...:
{
...:
"Name"
:
[
...:
"Braund, Mr. Owen Harris"
,
...:
"Allen, Mr. William Henry"
,
...:
"Bonnell, Miss. Elizabeth"
,
...:
],
...:
"Age"
:
[
22
,
35
,
58
],
...:
"Sex"
:
[
"male"
,
"male"
,
"female"
],
...:
}
...:
)
...:
In [3]:
df
Out[3]:
Name  Age     Sex
0   Braund, Mr. Owen Harris   22    male
1  Allen, Mr. William Henry   35    male
2  Bonnell, Miss. Elizabeth   58  female
To manually store data in a table, create a
DataFrame
. When using a Python dictionary of lists, the dictionary keys will be used as column headers and
the values in each list as columns of the
DataFrame
.
A
DataFrame
is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of
different types (including characters, integers, floating point values,
categorical data and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a
SQL table or the
data.frame
in R.
The table has 3 columns, each of them with a column label. The column
labels are respectively
Name
,
Age
and
Sex
.
The column
Name
consists of textual data with each value a
string, the column
Age
are numbers and the column
Sex
is
textual data.
In spreadsheet software, the table representation of our data would look
very similar:
Each column in a
DataFrame
is a
Series
#
Iâm just interested in working with the data in the column
Age
In [4]:
df
[
"Age"
]
Out[4]:
0    22
1    35
2    58
Name: Age, dtype: int64
When selecting a single column of a pandas
DataFrame
, the result is
a pandas
Series
. To select the column, use the column label in
between square brackets
[]
.
Note
If you are familiar with Python
dictionaries
, the selection of a
single column is very similar to the selection of dictionary values based on
the key.
You can create a
Series
from scratch as well:
In [5]:
ages
=
pd
.
Series
([
22
,
35
,
58
],
name
=
"Age"
)
In [6]:
ages
Out[6]:
0    22
1    35
2    58
Name: Age, dtype: int64
A pandas
Series
has no column labels, as it is just a single column
of a
DataFrame
. A Series does have row labels.
Do something with a DataFrame or Series
#
I want to know the maximum Age of the passengers
We can do this on the
DataFrame
by selecting the
Age
column and
applying
max()
:
In [7]:
df
[
"Age"
]
.
max
()
Out[7]:
58
Or to the
Series
:
In [8]:
ages
.
max
()
Out[8]:
58
As illustrated by the
max()
method, you can
do
things with a
DataFrame
or
Series
. pandas provides a lot of functionalities,
each of them a
method
you can apply to a
DataFrame
or
Series
.
As methods are functions, do not forget to use parentheses
()
.
Iâm interested in some basic statistics of the numerical data of my data table
In [9]:
df
.
describe
()
Out[9]:
Age
count   3.000000
mean   38.333333
std    18.230012
min    22.000000
25%    28.500000
50%    35.000000
75%    46.500000
max    58.000000
The
describe()
method provides a quick overview of the numerical data in
a
DataFrame
. As the
Name
and
Sex
columns are textual data,
these are by default not taken into account by the
describe()
method.
Many pandas operations return a
DataFrame
or a
Series
. The
describe()
method is an example of a pandas operation returning a
pandas
Series
or a pandas
DataFrame
.
To user guide
Check more options on
describe
in the user guide section about
aggregations with describe
Note
This is just a starting point. Similar to spreadsheet
software, pandas represents data as a table with columns and rows. Apart
from the representation, also the data manipulations and calculations
you would do in spreadsheet software are supported by pandas. Continue

REMEMBER
Import the package, aka
import
pandas
as
pd
A table of data is stored as a pandas
DataFrame
Each column in a
DataFrame
is a
Series
You can do things by applying a method to a
DataFrame
or
Series
To user guide
A more extended explanation to
DataFrame
and
Series
is provided in the
introduction to data structures
.
