Toy datasets
#
scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require to
download any file from some external website.
They can be loaded using the following functions:
load_iris
(*[, return_X_y, as_frame])
Load and return the iris dataset (classification).
load_diabetes
(*[, return_X_y, as_frame, scaled])
Load and return the diabetes dataset (regression).
load_digits
(*[, n_class, return_X_y, as_frame])
Load and return the digits dataset (classification).
load_linnerud
(*[, return_X_y, as_frame])
Load and return the physical exercise Linnerud dataset.
load_wine
(*[, return_X_y, as_frame])
Load and return the wine dataset (classification).
load_breast_cancer
(*[, return_X_y, as_frame])
Load and return the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (classification).
These datasets are useful to quickly illustrate the behavior of the
various algorithms implemented in scikit-learn. They are however often too
small to be representative of real world machine learning tasks.

The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken
from Fisher’s paper. Note that it’s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI
Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.
This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher’s paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits
The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where
each class refers to a digit.
Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract
normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a
total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13
to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of
4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates
an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range
0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small
distortions.

The data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same
region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different
measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of
wine.

https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle
aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
Separating plane described above was obtained using
Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, “Decision Tree
Construction Via Linear Programming.” Proceedings of the 4th
Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society,
pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear
programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features
were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4
features and 1-3 separating planes.
The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane
in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:
[K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: “Robust Linear
Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets”,
Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
