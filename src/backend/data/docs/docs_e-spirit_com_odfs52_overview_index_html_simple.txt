Overview
Welcome to the FirstSpirit Developer Documentation
For which users is this documentation intended?
This documentation deals with template development and plug-in development in FirstSpirit. By linking different sub-areas of the template development and by the sub-division into two difficulty levels for beginners (see
Basic principles of template development
) and for advanced users (see
Template development
) this documentation provides clearly structured information and should therefore make familiarisation with the template syntax of FirstSpirit easier.
Sub-areas of the online documentation
This online documentation is divided into the following main sections:

FirstSpirit is not a universal “out-of-the-box” product, but is software which is constantly being developed. New functions are continuously being integrated and customer ideas are realised. The documentation can only satisfy this constant updating process to a limited extent. It is therefore possible that a figure in this document differs from the current view in FirstSpirit due to slight time delays. Do not let it confuse you and follow the instructions as usual.
