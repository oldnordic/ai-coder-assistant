# Security Intelligence Guide (Updated v2.6.0)

## Overview
The Security Intelligence system provides real-time tracking of vulnerabilities, breaches, and patches from multiple sources. It is fully integrated with the backend and can be managed via the UI or configuration files.

## Features
- Add/remove/manage security feeds (RSS, Atom, API)
- View/filter/search vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Track security breaches and affected companies
- Monitor and apply security patches
- Export security data for AI training

## Usage
1. Open the **Security Intelligence** tab.
2. Use the **Feeds** sub-tab to add or remove feeds.
3. Use the **Vulnerabilities** sub-tab to view/filter/search CVEs.
4. Use the **Breaches** and **Patches** sub-tabs to monitor incidents and patches.
5. Use the **Training Data** sub-tab to export data for AI training.

## Configuration
- Feeds are managed in the UI or in `config/security_intelligence_config.json`.
- Sample feeds and data are provided by default.
- Feeds auto-refresh every 5 minutes; manual fetch is also available.

## Troubleshooting
- If no data appears, check feed URLs, network, and logs.
- Use the Refresh button to reload data.
- Ensure the backend is using the correct config path.

## Integration
- All data is accessible via the BackendController and REST API.
- For automation, use the API endpoints to fetch or update security data.

## Data Storage

Security data is stored in JSON files:

- `data/security_vulnerabilities.json` - Vulnerability data
- `data/security_breaches.json` - Breach information
- `data/security_patches.json` - Patch data
- `data/security_training_data.json` - Training data
- `config/security_intelligence_config.json` - Feed configuration

## Integration with AI Models

The Security Intelligence feature integrates with AI models in several ways:

### 1. Training Data Generation
Security data is automatically formatted for AI training:
- Structured vulnerability information
- Breach analysis and lessons learned
- Patch recommendations and procedures

### 2. Security-Aware Code Analysis
AI models can use security intelligence to:
- Identify vulnerable code patterns
- Suggest security improvements
- Recommend relevant patches
- Provide security context for code reviews

### 3. Automated Security Scanning
AI can leverage security data to:
- Scan code for known vulnerability patterns
- Suggest security fixes based on similar issues
- Provide security-aware code recommendations

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Updates
- Configure appropriate fetch intervals for feeds
- Regularly review and update feed configurations
- Monitor feed health and availability

### 2. Data Management
- Regularly export training data for AI models
- Archive old security data as needed
- Monitor data storage usage

### 3. Security Integration
- Integrate security intelligence with code review processes
- Use security data to inform development practices
- Train AI models with current security information

### 4. Feed Selection
- Choose reliable and authoritative security sources
- Diversify feed types and sources
- Regularly evaluate feed quality and relevance

## API Endpoints

The Security Intelligence feature provides REST API endpoints:

#### Feed Management
- `GET /api/security/feeds` - List configured feeds
- `POST /api/security/feeds` - Add new feed
- `DELETE /api/security/feeds/{feed_name}` - Remove feed
- `POST /api/security/feeds/fetch` - Fetch security data

#### Vulnerability Management
- `GET /api/security/vulnerabilities` - Get vulnerabilities
- `POST /api/security/vulnerabilities/{vuln_id}/patch` - Mark as patched

#### Breach Management
- `GET /api/security/breaches` - Get security breaches

#### Patch Management
- `GET /api/security/patches` - Get security patches
- `POST /api/security/patches/{patch_id}/apply` - Mark as applied

#### Training Data
- `GET /api/security/training-data` - Get training data

## Configuration

### Default Security Feeds

The system comes pre-configured with popular security feeds:

1. **NVD CVE Feed**: National Vulnerability Database
2. **SecurityWeek**: Security news and breach reports
3. **The Hacker News**: Security research and news
4. **CISA Alerts**: Government security advisories

### Adding Custom Feeds

To add a custom security feed:

1. Navigate to the Security Feeds tab
2. Click "Add Feed"
3. Provide feed information:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the feed
   - **URL**: Feed URL (RSS, Atom, or API endpoint)
   - **Type**: Feed type (rss, atom, api)
   - **Enabled**: Whether to enable the feed
   - **Fetch Interval**: How often to check for updates (in seconds)
   - **Tags**: Categories for the feed content

### Feed Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "Custom Security Feed",
  "url": "https://example.com/security-feed.xml",
  "feed_type": "rss",
  "enabled": true,
  "fetch_interval": 3600,
  "tags": ["vulnerability", "breach"]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Machine learning-based threat detection
- Integration with SIEM systems
- Advanced vulnerability correlation
- Real-time security alerts
- Custom security scoring algorithms
