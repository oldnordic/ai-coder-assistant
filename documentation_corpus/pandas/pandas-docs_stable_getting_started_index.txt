What kind of data does pandas handle?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you
to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a
DataFrame
.

How do I read and write tabular data?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
pandas supports the integration with many file formats or data sources out of the box (csv, excel, sql, json, parquet,â¦). Importing data from each of these
data sources is provided by function with the prefix
read_*
. Similarly, the
to_*
methods are used to store data.

How do I select a subset of a table?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
Selecting or filtering specific rows and/or columns? Filtering the data on a condition? Methods for slicing, selecting, and extracting the
data you need are available in pandas.

How to create plots in pandas?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
pandas provides plotting your data out of the box, using the power of Matplotlib. You can pick the plot type (scatter, bar, boxplot,â¦)
corresponding to your data.

How to create new columns derived from existing columns?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
There is no need to loop over all rows of your data table to do calculations. Data manipulations on a column work elementwise.
Adding a column to a
DataFrame
based on existing data in other columns is straightforward.

How to calculate summary statistics?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
Basic statistics (mean, median, min, max, countsâ¦) are easily calculable. These or custom aggregations can be applied on the entire
data set, a sliding window of the data, or grouped by categories. The latter is also known as the split-apply-combine approach.

How to reshape the layout of tables?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
Change the structure of your data table in multiple ways. You can
melt()
your data table from wide to long/tidy form or
pivot()
from long to wide format. With aggregations built-in, a pivot table is created with a single command.

How to combine data from multiple tables?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
Multiple tables can be concatenated both column wise and row wise as database-like join/merge operations are provided to combine multiple tables of data.

How to handle time series data?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
pandas has great support for time series and has an extensive set of tools for working with dates, times, and time-indexed data.

How to manipulate textual data?
Straight to tutorialâ¦
Data sets do not only contain numerical data. pandas provides a wide range of functions to clean textual data and extract useful information from it.

Are you familiar with other software for manipulating tabular data? Learn
the pandas-equivalent operations compared to software you already know:
The
R programming language
provides the
data.frame
data structure and multiple packages, such as
tidyverse
use and extend
data.frame
for convenient data handling functionalities similar to pandas.

Already familiar to
SELECT
,
GROUP
BY
,
JOIN
, etc.?
Most of these SQL manipulations do have equivalents in pandas.

The
data
set
included in the
STATA
statistical software suite corresponds to the pandas
DataFrame
.
Many of the operations known from STATA have an equivalent in pandas.

Users of
Excel
or other spreadsheet programs will find that many of the concepts are
transferrable to pandas.

The
SAS
statistical software suite
also provides the
data
set
corresponding to the pandas
DataFrame
.
Also SAS vectorized operations, filtering, string processing operations,
and more have similar functions in pandas.
