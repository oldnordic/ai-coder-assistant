#
Projects implementing the scikit-learn estimator API are encouraged to use
the
scikit-learn-contrib template
which facilitates best practices for testing and documenting estimators.
The
scikit-learn-contrib GitHub organization
also accepts high-quality contributions of repositories conforming to this
template.
Below is a list of sister-projects, extensions and domain specific packages.
Interoperability and framework enhancements
#
These tools adapt scikit-learn for use with other technologies or otherwise
enhance the functionality of scikit-learn’s estimators.

operators to design a machine learning pipeline, including data and feature
preprocessors as well as the estimators. Works as a drop-in replacement for a
scikit-learn estimator.

transforming temporal and relational datasets into feature matrices for
machine learning.
EvalML
An AutoML library which builds, optimizes, and evaluates
machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions.
It incorporates multiple modeling libraries under one API, and
the objects that EvalML creates use an sklearn-compatible API.

model building metadata.

A tool to help you configure,
organize, log and reproduce experiments
Scikit-Learn Laboratory

for interchange and
prediction.

A
persistence model more secure than pickle, which can be used instead of
pickle in most common cases.

into PMML with the help of

treelite
Compiles tree-based ensemble models into C code for minimizing prediction
latency.
emlearn
Implements scikit-learn estimators in C99 for embedded devices and microcontrollers.
Supports several classifier, regression and outlier detection models.
Model throughput
Intel(R) Extension for scikit-learn
Mostly on high end Intel(R) hardware, accelerates some scikit-learn models
for both training and inference under certain circumstances. This project is
maintained by Intel(R) and scikit-learn’s maintainers are not involved in the
development of this project. Also note that in some cases using the tools and
estimators under
scikit-learn-intelex
would give different results than
scikit-learn
itself. If you encounter issues while using this project,
make sure you report potential issues in their respective repositories.
Interface to R with genomic applications
BiocSklearn
Exposes a small number of dimension reduction facilities as an illustration
of the basilisk protocol for interfacing Python with R. Intended as a
springboard for more complete interop.

Translations of scikit-learn documentation
#
Translation’s purpose is to ease reading and understanding in languages
other than English. Its aim is to help people who do not understand English
or have doubts about its interpretation. Additionally, some people prefer
to read documentation in their native language, but please bear in mind that
the only official documentation is the English one

Those translation efforts are community initiatives and we have no control
on them.
If you want to contribute or report an issue with the translation, please
contact the authors of the translation.
Some available translations are linked here to improve their dissemination
and promote community efforts.
