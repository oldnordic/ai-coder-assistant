# Web Scraping Timeout Bug Fix

## Critical Bug Identified and Fixed

### Problem Description

A critical bug was identified in the web scraping functionality that prevented the processing of multiple URLs when one URL took a significant amount of time to scrape. This bug was located in the `crawl_docs` function in `src/backend/services/acquire.py`.

### Root Cause Analysis

**File**: `src/backend/services/acquire.py`  
**Function**: `crawl_docs`  
**Line**: 213 (original problematic code)

**The Problem**:
```python
# BUGGY CODE - This was causing the issue
for future in as_completed(future_to_url, timeout=timeout):
```

**Root Cause**: The `as_completed()` iterator had a timeout parameter that caused the entire loop to terminate if no future completed within the timeout period (defaulting to 30 seconds). This meant that if the first URL submitted took longer than 30 seconds to scrape, the loop would break with a `TimeoutError`, and the application would never process the results of other queued URLs.

### Impact

1. **Single URL Processing**: Only the first URL would be processed if it took longer than the timeout
2. **Lost URLs**: All subsequent URLs in the list would be ignored
3. **Poor User Experience**: Users would see incomplete results without understanding why
4. **Resource Waste**: Threads would be created but never utilized for other URLs

### Solution Implemented

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# FIXED CODE - Removed timeout from as_completed iterator
for future in as_completed(future_to_url):
    # ... other code ...
    try:
        # This correctly handles the timeout for each individual URL
        filepath, success = future.result(timeout=timeout)
        # ... rest of processing ...
    except TimeoutError:
        log_message_callback(f"Timeout processing {url}")
        errors.append(f"Timeout for {url}")
        # Continue processing other URLs
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Timeout from Iterator**: Removed `timeout=timeout` from the `as_completed()` call
2. **Preserved Individual Timeouts**: Kept the timeout on `future.result(timeout=timeout)` for individual URL processing
3. **Added Documentation**: Added detailed comments explaining the fix
4. **Maintained Error Handling**: Preserved all existing error handling and logging

### Technical Details

**Before Fix**:
- `as_completed(future_to_url, timeout=timeout)` - Global timeout on the iterator
- If any URL took longer than 30 seconds, the entire loop terminated
- Only the first URL would be processed in many cases

**After Fix**:
- `as_completed(future_to_url)` - No global timeout on the iterator
- `future.result(timeout=timeout)` - Individual timeout for each URL
- All URLs are processed regardless of individual timeouts
- Slow URLs are logged as timeouts but don't stop other processing

### Benefits of the Fix

1. **Complete URL Processing**: All URLs in the list are now processed
2. **Individual Timeout Handling**: Each URL can timeout independently without affecting others
3. **Better Resource Utilization**: All worker threads are utilized effectively
4. **Improved User Experience**: Users get results for all URLs, with clear timeout reporting
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Timeouts are properly logged and handled per URL

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Multiple URL Test**: Test with a list of URLs where some are slow and some are fast
2. **Timeout Test**: Test with URLs that are known to be slow or unresponsive
3. **Mixed Response Test**: Test with a mix of successful, failed, and timeout scenarios
4. **Concurrent Processing Test**: Verify that multiple URLs are processed in parallel
5. **Error Handling Test**: Verify that timeout errors are properly logged and handled

### Example Test Scenario

```python
# Test URLs with varying response times
test_urls = [
    "https://fast-site.com",           # Should complete quickly
    "https://slow-site.com",           # Should timeout after 30s
    "https://medium-site.com",         # Should complete in 10s
    "https://another-fast-site.com"    # Should complete quickly
]

# Before fix: Only fast-site.com would be processed
# After fix: All URLs are processed, slow-site.com times out, others complete
```

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Added Documentation**: Clear comments explaining the fix and why it was necessary
2. **Maintained Consistency**: Preserved existing error handling patterns
3. **Improved Reliability**: More robust processing of multiple URLs
4. **Better Logging**: Enhanced timeout reporting for individual URLs

### Related Components

This fix affects the following components:
- **Data Tab**: Web scraping functionality in the UI
- **acquire.py**: Core web scraping logic
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Multi-threading implementation
- **Progress Callbacks**: Progress reporting during scraping

### Future Considerations

1. **Configurable Timeouts**: Consider making timeouts configurable per URL type
2. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for failed URLs
3. **Progress Reporting**: Enhance progress reporting for timeout scenarios
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for timeout rates and processing times

### Conclusion

This critical bug fix ensures that the web scraping functionality works as intended, processing all URLs in the input list regardless of individual response times. The fix maintains the timeout protection for individual URLs while allowing the overall process to complete successfully.

The implementation follows best practices for concurrent programming and provides a robust foundation for web scraping operations in the AI Coder Assistant application.
