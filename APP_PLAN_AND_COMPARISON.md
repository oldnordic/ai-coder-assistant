# AI Coder Assistant: App Plan & Industry Comparison

## 1. What the App Does (Current Features)

- **AI-Powered Code Analysis**: Deep semantic, data flow, pattern, dependency, and security analysis for 20+ languages.
- **Multi-Threaded Scanning**: Fast, parallel code and document analysis.
- **Web Scraping**: Enhanced, configurable web crawler with debug logging, depth, and per-page link limits.
- **Document Acquisition**: Local and web-based documentation ingestion.
- **Model Training**: Train/fine-tune models on your own data; export to Ollama.
- **IDE Integrations**: VS Code, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ plugins.
- **Pull Request Automation**: AI-powered PR creation, fix suggestions, and prioritization.
- **Comprehensive UI**: PyQt6 desktop app with multi-tab workflow.
- **Security & Performance**: SSL verification, credential checks, file size/time limits, efficient threading.
- **Industry-Standard Testing**: Full suite for imports, constants, web scraping, security, and more.

## 2. What Is Missing / Gaps

- **Real-Time In-Editor Suggestions**: No live code completion/autocomplete in editors (unlike Copilot/TabNine).
- **Cloud Model Integration**: Limited to local Ollama and some API keys; lacks seamless cloud LLM integration.
- **Team Collaboration**: No real-time team code review or shared suggestions.
- **Marketplace/Plugin Ecosystem**: No extensible plugin system for third-party tools.
- **Advanced Refactoring**: Lacks automated large-scale refactoring tools.
- **Continuous Learning**: No automatic learning from user feedback across sessions.
- **Usage Analytics**: No built-in analytics or usage dashboards.
- **Mobile/Browser Support**: Desktop-only, no web or mobile client.
- **Enterprise Features**: No SSO, RBAC, or enterprise compliance modules.
