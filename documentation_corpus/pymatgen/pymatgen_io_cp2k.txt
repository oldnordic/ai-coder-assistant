pymatgen.io.cp2k package

Module for CP2K input/output parsing as well as sets for standard calculations.
Submodules

pymatgen.io.cp2k.inputs module

This module defines the building blocks of a CP2K input file. The CP2K input structure is
essentially a collection of “sections” which are similar to dictionary objects that activate
modules of the CP2K executable, and then “keywords” which adjust variables inside of those
modules. For example, FORCE_EVAL section will activate CP2K’s ability to calculate forces,
and inside FORCE_EVAL, the Keyword “METHOD can be set to “QS” to set the method of force
evaluation to be the quickstep (DFT) module.
A quick overview of the module:
– Section class defines the basis of CP2K input and contains methods for manipulating these
objects similarly to Dicts.
– Keyword class defines the keywords used inside of Section objects that changes variables in
CP2K programs.
– SectionList and KeywordList classes are lists of Section and Keyword objects that have
the same dictionary key. This deals with repeated sections and keywords.
– Cp2kInput class is special instantiation of Section that is used to represent the full CP2K
calculation input.
– The rest of the classes are children of Section intended to make initialization of common
sections easier.

Parameters
:
new_prec_each
(
int
) – How often to recalculate the preconditioner.
preconditioner
(
str
) –
Preconditioner to use.
“FULL_ALL”: Most effective state selective preconditioner based on diagonalization,
requires the ENERGY_GAP parameter to be an underestimate of the HOMO-LUMO gap.
This preconditioner is recommended for almost all systems, except very large
systems where make_preconditioner would dominate the total computational cost.
”FULL_KINETIC”: Cholesky inversion of S and T, fast construction, robust, use for
very large systems.
”FULL_SINGLE”: Based on H-eS diagonalization, not as good as FULL_ALL, but
somewhat cheaper to apply.
”FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE”: Based on H-eS cholesky inversion, similar to FULL_SINGLE
in preconditioning efficiency but cheaper to construct, might be somewhat
less robust. Recommended for large systems.
”FULL_S_INVERSE”: Cholesky inversion of S, not as good as FULL_KINETIC,
yet equally expensive.
”NONE”: skip preconditioning

Section
Controls printing of the electron density cube file.
Basic object representing a CP2K Section. Sections activate different parts of the
calculation. For example, FORCE_EVAL section will activate CP2K’s ability to calculate
forces.
Parameters
:
name
– The name of the section (must match name in CP2K)
subsections
– A dictionary of subsections that are nested in this section.
Format is {‘NAME’: Section(
args, **kwargs). The name you chose for ‘NAME’
to index that subsection does not *have
to be the same as the section’s true name,
but we recommend matching them. You can specify a blank dictionary if there are
no subsections, or if you want to insert the subsections later.
repeats
– Whether or not this section can be repeated. Most sections cannot.
Default=False.
description
– Description of this section for easier readability
keywords
– the keywords to be set for this section. Each element should be a
Keyword object. This can be more cumbersome than simply using kwargs for building
a class in a script, but is more convenient for the class instantiations of CP2K
sections (see below).
section_parameters
– the section parameters for this section. Section parameters
are specialized keywords that modify the behavior of the section overall. Most
sections do not have section parameters, but some do. Unlike normal Keywords,
these are specified as strings and not as Keyword objects.
location
– the path to the section in the form ‘SECTION/SUBSECTION1/SUBSECTION3’,
example for QS module: ‘FORCE_EVAL/DFT/QS’. This location is used to automatically
determine if a subsection requires a supersection to be activated.
verbose
– Controls how much is printed to CP2K input files (Also see Keyword).
If True, then a description of the section will be printed with it as a comment
(if description is set). Default=True.
alias
– An alias for this class to use in place of the name.

A keyword argument in CP2K. Within CP2K Sections, which activate features
of the CP2K code, the keywords are arguments that control the functionality of that feature.
For example, the section “FORCE_EVAL” activates the evaluation of forces/energies, but within
“FORCE_EVAL” the keyword “METHOD” controls whether or not this will be done with, say,
“Quickstep” (DFT) or “EIP” (empirical interatomic potential).
Initialize a keyword. These Keywords and the value passed to them are sometimes as simple
as KEYWORD VALUE, but can also be more elaborate such as KEYWORD [UNITS] VALUE1 VALUE2,
which is why this class exists: to handle many values and control easy printing to an
input file.
Parameters
:
name
– The name of this keyword. Must match an acceptable keyword from CP2K
values
– All non-keyword arguments after ‘name’ are interpreted as the values to set for
this keyword. i.e: KEYWORD ARG1 ARG2 would provide two values to the keyword.
description
– The description for this keyword. This can make readability of
input files easier for some. Default=None.
units
– The units for this keyword. If not specified, CP2K default units will be
used. Consult manual for default units. Default=None.
verbose
– Whether the description should be printed with the string of this keyword
repeats
– Whether or not this keyword may be repeated. Default=False.

Initialize the section from a Kpoints object (pymatgen.io.vasp.inputs). CP2K
does not have an automatic gamma-point constructor, so this is generally used
to get the number of divisions from a kpoint static constructor and then
build a Monkhorst-Pack grid, which is sufficient for gamma-recommended systems
so long as the grid is fine enough.
Parameters
:
kpoints
(
Kpoints
) – A pymatgen kpoints object.
structure
(
Structure
) – Required for automatically performing
symmetry analysis and reducing the kpoint grid.
reduce
– whether or not to reduce the grid using symmetry. CP2K itself cannot
do this automatically without spglib present at execution time.

Bases:
Section
Turns on the Orbital Transformation scheme for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. Often faster
and with guaranteed convergence compared to normal diagonalization, but requires the system
to have a band gap.
NOTE: OT has poor convergence for metallic systems and cannot use SCF mixing or smearing.
Therefore, you should not use it for metals or systems with ‘small’ band gaps. In that
case, use normal diagonalization
Initialize the OT section.
Parameters
:
minimizer
– The minimizer to use with the OT method. Default is conjugate gradient
method, which is more robust, but more well-behaved systems should use DIIS, which
can be as much as 50% faster.
preconditioner
– Preconditioner to use for OT, FULL_ALL tends to be most robust,
but is not always most efficient. For difficult systems, FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE can be
more robust, and is reasonably efficient with large systems. For huge, but well
behaved, systems, where construction of the preconditioner can take a very long
time, FULL_KINETIC can be a good choice.
algorithm
– What algorithm to use for OT. ‘Strict’: Taylor or diagonalization
based algorithm. IRAC: Orbital Transformation based Iterative Refinement of the
Approximate Congruence transformation (OT/IR).
rotation
– Introduce additional variables to allow subspace rotations (i.e fractional
occupations)
occupation_preconditioner
– include the fractional occupation in the preconditioning
energy_gap
– Guess for the band gap. For FULL_ALL, should be smaller than the
actual band gap, so simply using 0.01 is a robust value. Choosing a larger value
will help if you start with a bad initial guess though. For FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE,
energy_gap is treated as a lower bound. Values lower than 0.05 in this case can
lead to stability issues.
linesearch
(
str
) – From the manual: 1D line search algorithm to be used with the OT
minimizer, in increasing order of robustness and cost. MINIMIZER CG combined with
LINESEARCH GOLD should always find an electronic minimum. Whereas the 2PNT
minimizer is almost always OK, 3PNT might be needed for systems in which successive
OT CG steps do not decrease the total energy.

Basic input representation of input to CP2K. Activates functionality inside of the
CP2K executable.
Basic object representing a CP2K Section. Sections activate different parts of the
calculation. For example, FORCE_EVAL section will activate CP2K’s ability to calculate
forces.
Parameters
:
name
– The name of the section (must match name in CP2K)
subsections
– A dictionary of subsections that are nested in this section.
Format is {‘NAME’: Section(
args, **kwargs). The name you chose for ‘NAME’
to index that subsection does not *have
to be the same as the section’s true name,
but we recommend matching them. You can specify a blank dictionary if there are
no subsections, or if you want to insert the subsections later.
repeats
– Whether or not this section can be repeated. Most sections cannot.
Default=False.
description
– Description of this section for easier readability
keywords
– the keywords to be set for this section. Each element should be a
Keyword object. This can be more cumbersome than simply using kwargs for building
a class in a script, but is more convenient for the class instantiations of CP2K
sections (see below).
section_parameters
– the section parameters for this section. Section parameters
are specialized keywords that modify the behavior of the section overall. Most
sections do not have section parameters, but some do. Unlike normal Keywords,
these are specified as strings and not as Keyword objects.
location
– the path to the section in the form ‘SECTION/SUBSECTION1/SUBSECTION3’,
example for QS module: ‘FORCE_EVAL/DFT/QS’. This location is used to automatically
determine if a subsection requires a supersection to be activated.
verbose
– Controls how much is printed to CP2K input files (Also see Keyword).
If True, then a description of the section will be printed with it as a comment
(if description is set). Default=True.

[source]

Update the Section according to a dictionary argument. This is most useful
for providing user-override settings to default parameters. As you pass a

dct
(
dict
) –
A dictionary containing the update information. Should use nested dictionaries
to specify the full path of the update. If a section or keyword does not exist, it
will be created, but only with the values that are provided in “d”, not using
default values from a Section object.
Example: {
’SUBSECTION1’: {
‘SUBSEC2’: {‘NEW_KEYWORD’: ‘NEW_VAL’},
‘NEW_SUBSEC’: {‘NEW_KWD’: ‘NEW_VAL’}
}

– Whether or not this section can be repeated. Most sections cannot.
Default=False.
description
– Description of this section for easier readability
keywords
– the keywords to be set for this section. Each element should be a
Keyword object. This can be more cumbersome than simply using kwargs for building
a class in a script, but is more convenient for the class instantiations of CP2K
sections (see below).
section_parameters
– the section parameters for this section. Section parameters
are specialized keywords that modify the behavior of the section overall. Most
sections do not have section parameters, but some do. Unlike normal Keywords,
these are specified as strings and not as Keyword objects.
location
– the path to the section in the form ‘SECTION/SUBSECTION1/SUBSECTION3’,
example for QS module: ‘FORCE_EVAL/DFT/QS’. This location is used to automatically
determine if a subsection requires a supersection to be activated.
verbose
– Controls how much is printed to CP2K input files (Also see Keyword).
If True, then a description of the section will be printed with it as a comment
(if description is set). Default=True.
alias
– An alias for this class to use in place of the name.

but other parsing features may be called depending on the run type.
Initialize the Cp2kOutput object.
Parameters
:
filename

verbose
– (bool) Whether or not to parse with verbosity (will parse lots of data that
may not be useful)
auto_load
(
bool
) – Whether or not to automatically load basic info like energies
and structures.

parse_dos
(
dos_file
=
None
,
pdos_files
=
None
,
ldos_files

None
)
[source]

Parse the dos files produced by CP2K calculation. CP2K produces different files based
on the input file rather than assimilating them all into one file.
One file type is the overall DOS file, which is used for k-point calculations. For
non-kpoint calculation, the overall DOS is generally not calculated, but the
element-projected pDOS is. Separate files are created for each spin channel and each
atom kind. If requested, CP2K can also do site/local projected dos (ldos). Each site
requested will have a separate file for each spin channel (if spin polarized calculation
is performed).
If possible, this function will assimilate the ldos files into a CompleteDos object.
Either provide a list of PDOS file paths, or use glob to find the .pdos_ALPHA extension
in the calculation directory.
Parameters
:
dos_file
(
str
) – Name of the dos file, otherwise will be inferred
pdos_files

parse_energies
(
)
[source]


trajectory (pos.xyz) file takes precedence over the energy reported in the main output
file. This is because the trajectory file keeps track of energies in between restarts,
while the main output file may or may not depending on whether a particular machine
overwrites or appends it.
parse_files

by spin up/spin down channel and over many ionic steps, see parse_mo_eigenvalues().
parse_hyperfine
(
hyperfine_filename

None
)
[source]

Parse a file containing hyperfine coupling tensors for each atomic site.
parse_initial_structure

)
[source]

Parse the ionic step info. If already parsed, this will just assimilate.
parse_mo_eigenvalues
(
)
[source]

Parse the MO eigenvalues from the CP2K output file. Will get the eigenvalues (and band gap)
at each ionic step (if more than one exist).
Everything is decomposed by spin channel. If calculation was performed without spin
polarization, then only Spin.up will be present, which represents the average of up and
down.
parse_mulliken
(
)
[source]

Parse the mulliken population analysis info for each step.
parse_nmr_shift
(
)
[source]

Parse NMR calculation.
parse_opt_steps

Parse the SCF cycles (not usually important).
parse_scf_params

the convergence cutoff for scf (eps_scf),.
parse_stresses
(
)
[source]

Get the stresses from stress file, or from the main output file.
parse_structures
(
trajectory_file
=
None
,
lattice_file
=
None
)
[source]

Parse the structures from a CP2K calculation. Static calculations simply use the initial
structure. For calculations with ionic motion, the function will look for the appropriate
trajectory and lattice files based on naming convention. If no file is given, and no file
is found, it is assumed that the lattice/structure remained constant, and the initial
lattice/structure is used. CP2K does not output the trajectory in the main output file by
default, so non static calculations have to reference the trajectory file.
parse_tddfpt
(
)
[source]

Parse TDDFPT calculation.
parse_timing
(
)
[source]

Parse the timing info (how long did the run take).

:
patterns
(
dict
) – A dict of patterns, e.g.
{“energy”: r”energy\(sigma->0\)\s+=\s+([\d\-.]+)”}.

main body, footer. All the data matches “row pattern” in the main body
will be returned.
Parameters
:
header_pattern

) – The regular expression matches a single line in
the table. Capture interested field using regular expression
groups.
footer_pattern
(
str
) – The regular expression matches the end of the

attribute_name
(
str
) – Name of this table. If present the parsed data
will be attached to “data. e.g. self.data[“efg”] = […]
last_one_only
(
bool
) – All the tables will be parsed, if this option
is set to True, only the last table will be returned. The
enclosing list will be removed. i.e. Only a single table will
be returned. Default to be True.
strip
(
list
) – Whether or not to strip contents out of the file before
reading for a table pattern. This is mainly used by parse_scf_opt(),
to strip HFX info out of the SCF loop start or DFT+U warnings out
of the SCF loop iterations.
Returns
:
List of tables. 1) A table is a list of rows. 2) A row if either a list of
attribute values in case the the capturing group is defined without name in

pymatgen.io.cp2k.sets module

This module defines input sets for CP2K and is a work in progress. The structure/philosophy
of this module is based on the Vasp input sets in Pymatgen. These sets are meant to contain
tested parameters that will result in successful, reproducible, consistent calculations without
need for intervention 99% of the time. 99% of the time, you only need to provide a pymatgen
structure object and let the defaults take over from there.
The sets are intended to be very general, e.g. a set for geometry relaxation, and so most of the
time, if you have specific needs, you can simply specify them via the keyword argument
override_default_params (see Section.update() method). If you have the need to create a new input
set (say for a standardized high throughput calculation) then you can create a new child of the
Cp2kInputSet class.
In order to implement a new Set within the current code structure, follow this 3 step flow:
Inherit from Cp2kInputSet or one of its children and call the super() constructor
Create the new sections and insert them into self and its subsections as needed
Call self.update(override_default_params) in order to allow user settings.
class
CellOptSet
(
**
kwargs
)
[source]

Bases:
DftSet
Quick Constructor for cell optimization relaxation.
Parameters
:
structure
– Pymatgen structure or molecule object
basis_and_potential
(
dict
) – Basis set and pseudo-potential to use for each element.
See DftSet.get_basis_and_potential for allowed formats.
element_defaults
(
dict
) – Default settings such as initial magnetization for each
element. See DftSet.create_subsys for allowed formats.
ot
(
bool
) – Whether or not to use orbital transformation method for matrix
diagonalization. OT is the flagship scf solver of CP2K, and will provide
speed-ups for this part of the calculation, but the system must have a band gap
for OT to be used (higher band-gap –> faster convergence).
energy_gap
(
float
) – Estimate of energy gap for pre-conditioner. Default is -1, leaving
it up to CP2K.
eps_default
(
float
) – Replaces all EPS_XX Keywords in the DFT section value, ensuring
an overall accuracy of at least this much.
eps_scf
(
float
) –
The convergence criteria for leaving the SCF loop. Default is 1e-6.
Should ensure reasonable results, but is not applicable to all situations.
Note: eps_scf is
not
in units of energy, as in most DFT codes. For OT method,
it is the largest gradient of the energy with respect to changing any of the
molecular orbital coefficients. For diagonalization, it is the largest change
in the density matrix from the last step.
max_scf
(
int
) – The max number of SCF cycles before terminating the solver. NOTE: With
the OT solver, this corresponds to the max number of INNER scf loops, and then
the outer loops are set with outer_max_scf, while with diagonalization it
corresponds to the overall (INNER*OUTER) number of SCF steps, with the
inner loop limit set by
minimizer
(
str
) – The minimization scheme. DIIS can be as much as 50% faster than the
more robust conjugate gradient method, and so it is chosen as default. Switch to CG
if dealing with a difficult system.
preconditioner
(
str
) – Pre-conditioner for the OT method. FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE is very
robust and compatible with non-integer occupations from IRAC+rotation. FULL_ALL is
considered “best” but needs algorithm to be set to STRICT. Only change from these
two when simulation cell gets to be VERY large, in which case FULL_KINETIC might be
preferred.
algorithm
(
str
) – Algorithm for the OT method. STRICT assumes that the orbitals are
strictly orthogonal to each other, which works well for wide gap ionic systems,
but can diverge for systems with small gaps, fractional occupations, and some
other cases. IRAC (iterative refinement of the approximate congruency)
transformation is not analytically correct and uses a truncated polynomial
expansion, but is robust to the problems with STRICT, and so is the default.
linesearch
(
str
) – Linesearch method for CG. 2PNT is the default, and is the fastest,
but is not as robust as 3PNT. 2PNT is required as of CP2K v9.1 for compatibility
with irac+rotation. This may be upgraded in the future. 3PNT can be good for wide
gapped transition metal systems as an alternative.
rotation
(
bool
) – Whether or not to allow for rotation of the orbitals in the OT method.
This equates to allowing for fractional occupations in the calculation.
occupation_preconditioner
(
bool
) – Whether or not to account for fractional occupations
in the preconditioner. This method is not fully integrated as of CP2K v9.1 and is
set to false by default.
cutoff
(
int
) – Cutoff energy (in Ry) for the finest level of the multigrid. A high
cutoff will allow you to have very accurate calculations PROVIDED that REL_CUTOFF
is appropriate. By default cutoff is set to 0, leaving it up to the set.
rel_cutoff
(
int
) – This cutoff decides how the Gaussians are mapped onto the different
levels of the multigrid. If REL_CUTOFF is too low, then even if you have a high
CUTOFF, all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid,
and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too
coarse. By default 50Ry is chosen, which should be sufficient given the cutoff is
large enough.
ngrids
(
int
) – number of multi-grids to use. CP2K default is 4, but the molopt basis
files recommend 5.
progression_factor
(
int
) – Divisor of CUTOFF to get the cutoff for the next level of
the multigrid.
wfn_restart_file_name
(
str
) – RESTART file for the initial wavefunction guess.
kpoints
(
Kpoints
) – kpoints object from pymatgen.io.vasp.inputs.Kpoints. By default,
CP2K runs with gamma point only.
smearing
(
bool
) – whether or not to activate smearing (should be done for systems
containing no (or a very small) band gap.
cell
(
dict
[
str
,
Any
]
) – Keywords to add to the CELL section such as SYMMETRY.

Bases:
Cp2kInput
Base for an input set using the Quickstep module (i.e. a DFT calculation). The DFT section is
pretty vast in CP2K, so this set hopes to make the DFT setup fairly simple. The provided
parameters are pretty conservative, and so they should not need to be changed very often.
Parameters
:
structure
– Pymatgen structure or molecule object
basis_and_potential
(
dict
) – Basis set and pseudo-potential to use for each element.
See DftSet.get_basis_and_potential for allowed formats.
element_defaults

max_scf
(

the outer loops are set with outer_max_scf, while with diagonalization it
corresponds to the overall (INNER*OUTER) number of SCF steps, with the

in the preconditioner. This method is not fully integrated as of CP2K v9.1 and is
set to false by default.
cutoff
(
int
) – Cutoff energy (in Ry) for the finest level of the multigrid. A high
cutoff will allow you to have very accurate calculations PROVIDED that REL_CUTOFF
is appropriate. By default cutoff is set to 0, leaving it up to the set.
rel_cutoff
(
int
) – This cutoff decides how the Gaussians are mapped onto the different
levels of the multigrid. If REL_CUTOFF is too low, then even if you have a high
CUTOFF, all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid,
and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too
coarse. By default 50Ry is chosen, which should be sufficient given the cutoff is
large enough.

Basic set for activating hybrid DFT calculation using Auxiliary Density Matrix Method.
Note 1: When running ADMM with CP2K, memory is very important. If the memory requirements
exceed what is available (see max_memory), then CP2K will have to calculate the 4-electron
integrals for HFX during each step of the SCF cycle. ADMM provides a huge speed up by
making the memory requirements
feasible
to fit into RAM, which means you only need to
calculate the integrals once each SCF cycle. But, this only works if it fits into memory.
When setting up ADMM calculations, we recommend doing whatever is possible to fit all the
4EI into memory.
Note 2: This set is designed for reliable high-throughput calculations, NOT for extreme
accuracy. Please review the in-line comments in this method if you want more control.
Parameters
:
hybrid_functional
(
str
) – Type of hybrid functional. This set supports HSE (screened)
and PBE0 (truncated). Default is PBE0, which converges easier in the GPW basis
used by CP2K.
hf_fraction
(
float
) – fraction of exact HF exchange energy to mix. Default: 0.25
gga_x_fraction
(
float
) – fraction of gga exchange energy to retain. Default: 0.75
gga_c_fraction
(
float
) – fraction of gga correlation energy to retain. Default: 1.0
max_memory
(
int
) – Maximum memory available to each MPI process (in Mb) in the
calculation. Most modern computing nodes will have ~2Gb per core, or 2048 Mb,
but check for your specific system. This value should be as large as possible
while still leaving some memory for the other parts of CP2K. Important: If
this value is set larger than the memory limits, CP2K will likely seg-fault.
Default: 2000
cutoff_radius
(
float
) – for truncated hybrid functional (i.e. PBE0), this is the cutoff
radius. The default is selected as that which generally gives convergence, but
maybe too low (if you want very high accuracy) or too high (if you want a quick
screening). Default: 8 angstroms
potential_type
(
str
) – what interaction potential to use for HFX. Available in CP2K are
COULOMB, GAUSSIAN, IDENTITY, LOGRANGE, MIX_CL, MIX_CL_TRUNC, MIX_LG, SHORTRANGE,
and TRUNCATED. Default is None, and it will be set automatically depending on the
named hybrid_functional that you use, but setting it to one of the acceptable
values will constitute a user-override.
omega
(
float
) – For HSE, this specifies the screening parameter. HSE06 sets this as
0.2, which is the default.
scale_coulomb
– Scale for the coulomb operator if using a range separated functional
scale_gaussian
– Scale for the gaussian operator (if applicable)
scale_longrange
– Scale for the coulomb operator if using a range separated functional
admm
– Whether or not to use the auxiliary density matrix method for the exact
HF exchange contribution. Highly recommended. Speed ups between 10x and 1000x are
possible when compared to non ADMM hybrid calculations.
admm_method
– Method for constructing the auxiliary basis
admm_purification_method
– Method for purifying the auxiliary density matrix so as to
preserve properties, such as idempotency. May lead to shifts in the
eigenvalues.
admm_exch_correction_func
– Which functional to use to calculate the exchange correction
E_x(primary) - E_x(aux)
eps_schwarz
– Screening threshold for HFX, in Ha. Contributions smaller than
this will be screened. The smaller the value, the more accurate, but also the more
costly. Default value is 1e-7. 1e-6 works in a large number of cases, but is
quite aggressive, which can lead to convergence issues.
eps_schwarz_forces
– Same as for eps_schwarz, but for screening contributions to
forces. Convergence is not as sensitive with respect to eps_schwarz forces as
compared to eps_schwarz, and so 1e-6 should be good default.
screen_on_initial_p
– If an initial density matrix is provided, in the form of a
CP2K wfn restart file, then this initial density will be used for screening. This
is generally very computationally efficient, but, as with eps_schwarz, can lead to
instabilities if the initial density matrix is poor.
screen_p_forces
– Same as screen_on_initial_p, but for screening of forces.

Get a dictionary of basis and potential info for constructing the input file.
data in basis_and_potential argument can be specified in several ways:
Strategy 1: Element-specific info (takes precedence)
Provide a basis and potential object:
el: {‘basis’: obj, ‘potential’: obj}
Provide a hash of the object that matches the keys in the pmg configured CP2K data files.
el: {‘basis’: hash, ‘potential’: hash}
3. Provide the name of the basis and potential AND the basis_filenames and potential_filename
keywords specifying where to find these objects
el: {
‘basis’: name, ‘potential’: name, ‘basis_filenames’: [filenames],
‘potential_filename’: filename
}
Strategy 2: global descriptors
In this case, any elements not present in the argument will be dealt with by searching the pmg
configured CP2K data files to find a objects matching your requirements.
functional: Find potential and basis that have been optimized for a specific functional like PBE.
Can be None if you do not require them to match.
basis_type: type of basis to search for (e.g. DZVP-MOLOPT).
aux_basis_type: type of basis to search for (e.g. pFIT). Some elements do not have all aux types
available. Use aux_basis_type that is universal to avoid issues, or avoid using this strategy.
potential_type: “Pseudopotential” or “All Electron”

DftSet
Quick Constructor for hybrid cell optimization relaxation.
Parameters
:

basis_and_potential
(
dict

See DftSet.get_basis_and_potential for allowed formats.
element_defaults
(
dict
) – Default settings such as initial magnetization for each
element. See DftSet.create_subsys for allowed formats.
ot
(
bool
) – Whether or not to use orbital transformation method for matrix
diagonalization. OT is the flagship scf solver of CP2K, and will provide
speed-ups for this part of the calculation, but the system must have a band gap
for OT to be used (higher band-gap –> faster convergence).
energy_gap
(
float
) – Estimate of energy gap for pre-conditioner. Default is -1, leaving
it up to CP2K.
eps_default
(
float
) – Replaces all EPS_XX Keywords in the DFT section value, ensuring
an overall accuracy of at least this much.
eps_scf
(
float
) –
The convergence criteria for leaving the SCF loop. Default is 1e-6.
Should ensure reasonable results, but is not applicable to all situations.
Note: eps_scf is
not
in units of energy, as in most DFT codes. For OT method,
it is the largest gradient of the energy with respect to changing any of the
molecular orbital coefficients. For diagonalization, it is the largest change
in the density matrix from the last step.
max_scf
(
int
) – The max number of SCF cycles before terminating the solver. NOTE: With
the OT solver, this corresponds to the max number of INNER scf loops, and then
the outer loops are set with outer_max_scf, while with diagonalization it
corresponds to the overall (INNER*OUTER) number of SCF steps, with the
inner loop limit set by
minimizer
(
str
) – The minimization scheme. DIIS can be as much as 50% faster than the
more robust conjugate gradient method, and so it is chosen as default. Switch to CG
if dealing with a difficult system.
preconditioner
(
str
) – Pre-conditioner for the OT method. FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE is very
robust and compatible with non-integer occupations from IRAC+rotation. FULL_ALL is
considered “best” but needs algorithm to be set to STRICT. Only change from these
two when simulation cell gets to be VERY large, in which case FULL_KINETIC might be
preferred.
algorithm
(
str
) – Algorithm for the OT method. STRICT assumes that the orbitals are
strictly orthogonal to each other, which works well for wide gap ionic systems,
but can diverge for systems with small gaps, fractional occupations, and some
other cases. IRAC (iterative refinement of the approximate congruency)
transformation is not analytically correct and uses a truncated polynomial
expansion, but is robust to the problems with STRICT, and so is the default.
linesearch
(
str
) – Linesearch method for CG. 2PNT is the default, and is the fastest,
but is not as robust as 3PNT. 2PNT is required as of CP2K v9.1 for compatibility
with irac+rotation. This may be upgraded in the future. 3PNT can be good for wide
gapped transition metal systems as an alternative.
rotation
(
bool
) – Whether or not to allow for rotation of the orbitals in the OT method.
This equates to allowing for fractional occupations in the calculation.
occupation_preconditioner
(
bool
) – Whether or not to account for fractional occupations
in the preconditioner. This method is not fully integrated as of CP2K v9.1 and is
set to false by default.
cutoff
(
int
) – Cutoff energy (in Ry) for the finest level of the multigrid. A high
cutoff will allow you to have very accurate calculations PROVIDED that REL_CUTOFF
is appropriate. By default cutoff is set to 0, leaving it up to the set.
rel_cutoff
(

CUTOFF, all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid,
and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too
coarse. By default 50Ry is chosen, which should be sufficient given the cutoff is
large enough.
ngrids
(
int
) – number of multi-grids to use. CP2K default is 4, but the molopt basis
files recommend 5.
progression_factor
(
int
) – Divisor of CUTOFF to get the cutoff for the next level of
the multigrid.
wfn_restart_file_name
(
str
) – RESTART file for the initial wavefunction guess.
kpoints
(
Kpoints
) – kpoints object from pymatgen.io.vasp.inputs.Kpoints. By default,
CP2K runs with gamma point only.

class
HybridStaticSet
(
**
kwargs
)
[source]

Bases:
DftSet
Quick Constructor for static calculations.
Parameters
:
structure
– Pymatgen structure or molecule object
basis_and_potential
(
dict
) – Basis set and pseudo-potential to use for each element.
See DftSet.get_basis_and_potential for allowed formats.
element_defaults
(
dict
) – Default settings such as initial magnetization for each
element. See DftSet.create_subsys for allowed formats.
ot
(
bool
) – Whether or not to use orbital transformation method for matrix
diagonalization. OT is the flagship scf solver of CP2K, and will provide
speed-ups for this part of the calculation, but the system must have a band gap
for OT to be used (higher band-gap –> faster convergence).
energy_gap
(
float
) – Estimate of energy gap for pre-conditioner. Default is -1, leaving
it up to CP2K.
eps_default
(
float
) – Replaces all EPS_XX Keywords in the DFT section value, ensuring
an overall accuracy of at least this much.
eps_scf
(
float
) –
The convergence criteria for leaving the SCF loop. Default is 1e-6.
Should ensure reasonable results, but is not applicable to all situations.
Note: eps_scf is
not
in units of energy, as in most DFT codes. For OT method,
it is the largest gradient of the energy with respect to changing any of the
molecular orbital coefficients. For diagonalization, it is the largest change
in the density matrix from the last step.
max_scf
(
int
) – The max number of SCF cycles before terminating the solver. NOTE: With
the OT solver, this corresponds to the max number of INNER scf loops, and then
the outer loops are set with outer_max_scf, while with diagonalization it
corresponds to the overall (INNER*OUTER) number of SCF steps, with the
inner loop limit set by
minimizer
(
str
) – The minimization scheme. DIIS can be as much as 50% faster than the
more robust conjugate gradient method, and so it is chosen as default. Switch to CG
if dealing with a difficult system.
preconditioner
(
str
) – Pre-conditioner for the OT method. FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE is very
robust and compatible with non-integer occupations from IRAC+rotation. FULL_ALL is
considered “best” but needs algorithm to be set to STRICT. Only change from these
two when simulation cell gets to be VERY large, in which case FULL_KINETIC might be
preferred.
algorithm
(
str
) – Algorithm for the OT method. STRICT assumes that the orbitals are
strictly orthogonal to each other, which works well for wide gap ionic systems,
but can diverge for systems with small gaps, fractional occupations, and some
other cases. IRAC (iterative refinement of the approximate congruency)
transformation is not analytically correct and uses a truncated polynomial
expansion, but is robust to the problems with STRICT, and so is the default.
linesearch
(
str
) – Linesearch method for CG. 2PNT is the default, and is the fastest,
but is not as robust as 3PNT. 2PNT is required as of CP2K v9.1 for compatibility
with irac+rotation. This may be upgraded in the future. 3PNT can be good for wide
gapped transition metal systems as an alternative.
rotation
(
bool
) – Whether or not to allow for rotation of the orbitals in the OT method.
This equates to allowing for fractional occupations in the calculation.
occupation_preconditioner
(
bool
) – Whether or not to account for fractional occupations
in the preconditioner. This method is not fully integrated as of CP2K v9.1 and is
set to false by default.
cutoff
(
int
) – Cutoff energy (in Ry) for the finest level of the multigrid. A high
cutoff will allow you to have very accurate calculations PROVIDED that REL_CUTOFF
is appropriate. By default cutoff is set to 0, leaving it up to the set.
rel_cutoff
(
int
) – This cutoff decides how the Gaussians are mapped onto the different
levels of the multigrid. If REL_CUTOFF is too low, then even if you have a high
CUTOFF, all Gaussians will be mapped onto the coarsest level of the multi-grid,
and thus the effective integration grid for the calculation may still be too
coarse. By default 50Ry is chosen, which should be sufficient given the cutoff is
large enough.
ngrids
(
int
) – number of multi-grids to use. CP2K default is 4, but the molopt basis
files recommend 5.
progression_factor
(
int
) – Divisor of CUTOFF to get the cutoff for the next level of
the multigrid.
wfn_restart_file_name
(
str
) – RESTART file for the initial wavefunction guess.
kpoints
(
Kpoints
) – kpoints object from pymatgen.io.vasp.inputs.Kpoints. By default,
CP2K runs with gamma point only.
smearing
(
bool
) – whether or not to activate smearing (should be done for systems
containing no (or a very small) band gap.

pymatgen.io.cp2k.utils module

Utility functions for assisting with CP2K IO.
chunk
(
string
:
str
)
[source]

Chunk the string from a CP2K basis or potential file.
get_truncated_coulomb_cutoff
(
inp_struct
:
Structure
)
[source]

Get the truncated Coulomb cutoff for a given structure.
get_unique_site_indices
(
struct
:
Structure
|
Molecule
)
[source]

Get unique site indices for a structure according to site properties. Whatever site-property
has the most unique values is used for indexing.
For example, if you have magnetic CoO with half Co atoms having a positive moment, and the
other half having a negative moment. Then this function will create a dict of sites for
Co_1, Co_2, O. This function also deals with “Species” properties like oxi_state and spin by
pushing them to site properties.
This creates unique sites, based on site properties, but does not have anything to do with
turning those site properties into CP2K input parameters. This will only be done for properties
which can be turned into CP2K input parameters, which are stored in parsable_site_properties.
natural_keys
(
text
:
str
)
[source]

Sort text by numbers coming after an underscore with natural number
convention,
Ex: [file_1, file_12, file_2] becomes [file_1, file_2, file_12].
postprocessor

)
→
str
|

[source]

Helper function to post process the results of the pattern matching functions in Cp2kOutput
and turn them to Python types.
Parameters
:
data
(
str
) – The data to be post processed.
Raises
:
ValueError
– If the data cannot be parsed.
Returns
:
The post processed data.
Return type
:

)
→
str
[source]

CP2K contains internal preprocessor flags that are evaluated before execution. This helper
function recognizes those preprocessor flags and replaces them with an equivalent CP2K input
(this way everything is contained neatly in the CP2K input structure, even if the user preferred
to use the flags.
CP2K preprocessor flags (with arguments) are:
@INCLUDE FILENAME: Insert the contents of FILENAME into the file at
this location.
@SET VAR VALUE: set a variable, VAR, to have the value, VALUE.
$VAR or ${VAR}: replace these with the value of the variable, as set
by the @SET flag.
@IF/@ELIF: Not implemented yet.
Parameters
:
data
(
str
) – CP2K input to preprocess
dir
(
str
,
optional
) – Path for include files. Default is ‘.’ (current directory).
Returns
:
Preprocessed string
