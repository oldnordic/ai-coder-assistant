This module provides an interface for parsing TOML 1.0.0 (Tomâs Obvious Minimal
Language,
). This module does not
support writing TOML.

The
is a TOML writer that can be used in conjunction with this module,
providing a write API familiar to users of the standard library
and
modules.

The
is a style-preserving TOML library with both read and write capability.
It is a recommended replacement for this module for editing already
existing TOML files.
This module defines the following functions:
tomllib.
load
(
fp
,
/
,
*
,
parse_float
=
float
)
Read a TOML file. The first argument should be a readable and binary file object.
Return a
. Convert TOML types to Python using this
.
parse_float
will be called with the string of every TOML
float to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
float(num_str)
.
This can be used to use another datatype or parser for TOML floats
(e.g.
). The callable must not return a
or a
, else a
is raised.
A
will be raised on an invalid TOML document.
tomllib.
loads
(
s
,
/
,
*
,
parse_float
=
float
)
Load TOML from a
object. Return a
. Convert TOML
types to Python using this
. The
parse_float
argument has the same meaning as in

A

The following exceptions are available:
