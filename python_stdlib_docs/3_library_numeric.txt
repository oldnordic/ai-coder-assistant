The modules described in this chapter provide numeric and math-related functions
and data types. The
module defines an abstract hierarchy of
numeric types. The
and
modules contain various
mathematical functions for floating-point and complex numbers. The
module supports exact representations of decimal numbers, using arbitrary precision
arithmetic.
The following modules are documented in this chapter:
