Using Gitpod for pandas development
#
This section of the documentation will guide you through:
using Gitpod for your pandas development environment
creating a personal fork of the pandas repository on GitHub
a quick tour of pandas and VSCode
working on the pandas documentation in Gitpod
Gitpod
#
Gitpod
is an open-source platform for automated and ready-to-code
development environments. It enables developers to describe their dev
environment as code and start instant and fresh development environments for
each new task directly from your browser. This reduces the need to install local
development environments and deal with incompatible dependencies.
Gitpod GitHub integration
#
To be able to use Gitpod, you will need to have the Gitpod app installed on your
GitHub account, so if
you do not have an account yet, you will need to create one first.
To get started just login at
Gitpod
, and grant the appropriate permissions to GitHub.
We have built a python 3.10 environment and all development dependencies will
install when the environment starts.
Forking the pandas repository
#
The best way to work on pandas as a contributor is by making a fork of the
repository first.
Browse to the
pandas repository on GitHub
and
create your own fork
.
Browse to your fork. Your fork will have a URL like
noatamir/pandas-dev
, except with your GitHub username in place of
noatamir
.
Starting Gitpod
#
Once you have authenticated to Gitpod through GitHub, you can install the
Gitpod Chromium or Firefox browser extension
which will add a
Gitpod
button next to the
Code
button in the
repository:
If you install the extension - you can click the
Gitpod
button to start
a new workspace.
Alternatively, if you do not want to install the browser extension, you can
visit
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/USERNAME/pandas
replacing
USERNAME
with your GitHub username.
In both cases, this will open a new tab on your web browser and start
building your development environment. Please note this can take a few
minutes.
Once the build is complete, you will be directed to your workspace,
including the VSCode editor and all the dependencies you need to work on
pandas. The first time you start your workspace, you will notice that there
might be some actions running. This will ensure that you have a development
version of pandas installed.
When your workspace is ready, you can
test the build
by
entering:
$ python -m pytest pandas
Note that this command takes a while to run, so once youâve confirmed itâs running you may want to cancel it using ctrl-c.
Quick workspace tour
#
Gitpod uses VSCode as the editor. If you have not used this editor before, you
can check the Getting started
VSCode docs
to familiarize yourself with it.
Your workspace will look similar to the image below:
We have marked some important sections in the editor:
Your current Python interpreter - by default, this is
pandas-dev
and
should be displayed in the status bar and on your terminal. You do not need
to activate the conda environment as this will always be activated for you.
Your current branch is always displayed in the status bar. You can also use
this button to change or create branches.
GitHub Pull Requests extension - you can use this to work with Pull Requests
from your workspace.
Marketplace extensions - we have added some essential extensions to the pandas
Gitpod. Still, you can also install other extensions or syntax highlighting
themes for your user, and these will be preserved for you.
Your workspace directory - by default, it is
/workspace/pandas-dev
.
Do not
change this
as this is the only directory preserved in Gitpod.
We have also pre-installed a few tools and VSCode extensions to help with the
development experience:
VSCode rst extension
Markdown All in One
VSCode Gitlens extension
VSCode Git Graph extension
Development workflow with Gitpod
#
The
Contributing to pandas
section of this documentation contains
information regarding the pandas development workflow. Make sure to check this
before working on your contributions.
When using Gitpod, git is pre configured for you:
You do not need to configure your git username, and email as this should be
done for you as you authenticated through GitHub. Unless you are using GitHub
feature to keep email address private. You can check the git
configuration with the command
git
config
--list
in your terminal. Use
git
config
--global
user.email
âyour-secret-email@users.noreply.github.comâ
to set your email address to the one you use to make commits with your github
profile.
As you started your workspace from your own pandas fork, you will by default
have both
upstream
and
origin
added as remotes. You can verify this by
typing
git
remote
on your terminal or by clicking on the
branch name
on the status bar (see image below).
Rendering the pandas documentation
#
You can find the detailed documentation on how rendering the documentation with
Sphinx works in the
How to build the pandas documentation
section. To build the full
docs you need to run the following command in the
/doc
directory:
$ cd doc
$ python make.py html
Alternatively you can build a single page with:
python
make
.
py
--
single
development
/
contributing_gitpod
.
rst
You have two main options to render the documentation in Gitpod.
Option 1: using Liveserve
#
View the documentation in
pandas/doc/build/html
.
To see the rendered version of a page, you can right-click on the
.html
file and click on
Open with Live Serve
. Alternatively, you can open the
file in the editor and click on the
Go live
button on the status bar.
A simple browser will open to the right-hand side of the editor. We recommend
closing it and click on the
Open in browser
button in the pop-up.
To stop the server click on the
Port: 5500
button on the status bar.
Option 2: using the rst extension
#
A quick and easy way to see live changes in a
.rst
file as you work on it
uses the rst extension with docutils.
Note
This will generate a simple live preview of the document without the
html
theme, and some backlinks might not be added correctly. But it is an
easy and lightweight way to get instant feedback on your work, without
building the html files.
Open any of the source documentation files located in
doc/source
in the
editor.
Open VSCode Command Palette with
Cmd
-
Shift
-
P
in Mac or
Ctrl
-
Shift
-
P
in Linux and Windows. Start typing ârestructuredâ
and choose either âOpen previewâ or âOpen preview to the Sideâ.
As you work on the document, you will see a live rendering of it on the editor.
If you want to see the final output with the
html
theme you will need to
rebuild the docs with
make
html
and use Live Serve as described in option 1.
FAQâs and troubleshooting
#
How long is my Gitpod workspace kept for?
#
Your stopped workspace will be kept for 14 days and deleted afterwards if you do
not use them.
Can I come back to a previous workspace?
#
Yes, letâs say you stepped away for a while and you want to carry on working on
your pandas contributions. You need to visit
https://gitpod.io/workspaces
and
click on the workspace you want to spin up again. All your changes will be there
as you last left them.
Can I install additional VSCode extensions?
#
Absolutely! Any extensions you installed will be installed in your own workspace
and preserved.
I registered on Gitpod but I still cannot see a
Gitpod
button in my repositories.
#
Head to
https://gitpod.io/integrations
and make sure you are logged in.
Hover over GitHub and click on the three buttons that appear on the right.
Click on edit permissions and make sure you have
user:email
,
read:user
, and
public_repo
checked. Click on
Update Permissions
and confirm the changes in the GitHub application page.
How long does my workspace stay active if Iâm not using it?
#
If you keep your workspace open in a browser tab but donât interact with it,
it will shut down after 30 minutes. If you close the browser tab, it will
shut down after 3 minutes.
My terminal is blank - there is no cursor and itâs completely unresponsive
#
Unfortunately this is a known-issue on Gitpodâs side. You can sort this
issue in two ways:
Create a new Gitpod workspace altogether.
Head to your
Gitpod dashboard
and locate
the running workspace. Hover on it and click on the
three dots menu
and then click on
Stop
. When the workspace is completely stopped you
can click on its name to restart it again.
I authenticated through GitHub but I still cannot commit to the repository through Gitpod.
#
Head to
