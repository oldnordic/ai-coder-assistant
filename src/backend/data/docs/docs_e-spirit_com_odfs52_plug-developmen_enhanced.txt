Overview
Welcome to the FirstSpirit Developer Documentation
For which users is this documentation intended?
This documentation deals with template development and plug-in development in FirstSpirit. By linking different sub-areas of the template development and by the sub-division into two difficulty levels for beginners (see
Basic principles of template development
) and for advanced users (see
Template development
) this documentation provides clearly structured information and should therefore make familiarisation with the template syntax of FirstSpirit easier.
Sub-areas of the online documentation
This online documentation is divided into the following main sections:

FirstSpirit is not a universal “out-of-the-box” product, but is software which is constantly being developed. New functions are continuously being integrated and customer ideas are realised. The documentation can only satisfy this constant updating process to a limited extent. It is therefore possible that a figure in this document differs from the current view in FirstSpirit due to slight time delays. Do not let it confuse you and follow the instructions as usual.

Templates (basics)
The basics of template development
The strict
separation
of layout, content and structure is one part of the basics of working with FirstSpirit. Here, FirstSpirit consistently supports
multiple languages
.
Every FirstSpirit project is based on what are called “templates”. These are used as a type of framework or structure to link together all of a project's content. Templates are developed individually for each project. A distinction is made between different types of templates. FirstSpirit collects all templates of a project in the templates store. A brief introduction covering this topic can be found in the
Composition of templates
section.
Chapter
First project
(menu item
Tutorials
) serves as access point into FirstSpirit template development. It shows quickly and straightforwardly with the aid of an example project how projects can be realized efficiently with FirstSpirit.

ContentCreator Extensions
ContentCreator Extensions
ContentCreator is designed to provide a safe and easy-to-use authoring environment for use by subject matter expert editors who do not require the complete range of content management capabilities available in the SiteArchitect. As part of the ContentCreator's user-centered design, we provide project developers with means to design custom functionality that presents additional interaction features that will help editors perform specific tasks.
To this end, ContentCreator includes a plug-in infrastructure that allows modular extensions of the user interface as well as internal functionality. ContentCreator extensions are implemented in Java, installed as server modules or project-specific scripts and may use the FirstSpirit Access and Developer APIs.
This chapter aims to provide a quick-start guide towards understanding the client's plug-in capabilities, implementing the essential aspects of each plug-in type and deploying complete plug-ins for use in the ContentCreator. This document does
not
aim to be a complete API documentation or to provide guidance in using FirstSpirit core functionality beyond what is required to extend the ContentCreator's user interface;
the FirstSpirit Access API documentation sets
, along with JavaDoc mark-up available in development environments, provide thorough information on these subjects.
While the official, public name of the web-based editing environment in FirstSpirit 5 is
ContentCreator
, the internal name follows the traditional term
WebEdit
, which had been used up to and including FirstSpirit 4.
The FirstSpirit API and the ServerManager application continue to use the
WebEdit
name.
This chapter contains annotated code examples that describe individual plug-in classes and their methods in order to illustrate the required plug-in architecture, as well as API usage to control certain aspects of the ContentCreator user interface. The code examples have deliberately been kept simple for readability and demonstration of core concepts; thus, they do not aim to be code-complete or compilable.
The FirstSpirit Module source code package
ContentCreator Examples
provides complete, compilable and functional examples for each plug-in type. This source code combines various examples in this documentation to illustrate real-world use of ContentCreator extensions.
Extension Overview and Examples
ContentCreator Extensions
Each section describes several plug-in types and includes functional descriptions of plug-in features, implementation details and documented example code with references to the FirstSpirit API documentation.
Interactive Features
This section introduces the extension types that can be added to the ContentCreator's user interface.
Management Extensions
This section documents the administrative features that can be added to provide project-specific content handling.
Module Development and Deployment
Implementation and Deployment
This section provides high-level guidance towards implementing additional ContentCreator functionality using the FSM format and FirstSpirit APIs, and illustrates the FSM roll-out process.

Implementation and Deployment
Implementation and Deployment
FirstSpirit client extensions are normally implemented in Java code, access the
FirstSpirit APIs
for integration with FirstSpirit client and server components, and are deployed to FirstSpirit servers packaged into
FirstSpirit Modules (FSM)
.
This chapter provides basic descriptions of and links to further information about using FirstSpirit API functionality as well as designing and deploying FirstSpirit Modules.
While SiteArchitect plug-ins are loaded client-side and communicate with the server through API calls, ContentCreator plug-ins are generally loaded server-side and use operations to cause interactions with the client side. The chapter
Using FirstSpirit APIs
distinguishes between client-side and server-side operations when necessary.
Most ContentCreator extensions are deployed using FirstSpirit Modules (FSM) and require roll-out to a project-specific ContentCreator web application after installation on a FirstSpirit server. A detailed description of the ContentCreator-specific roll-out process is available in the chapter
Deploying Modules
.
The following client extensions are not generally deployed within FSM but are added to a project's templates:
Beanshell scripts
These are included in a project's Template Store folder, "Scripts". Scripting in FirstSpirit is introduced in the section
Template Development: Scripting
.
FS_BUTTON instances
These are defined in the form and relevant output channels of page, section or table templates. Please see the chapter
FS_BUTTON (Template Development)
for details. Details on providing interactive features for this button component are provided in the chapter
Using FirstSpirit APIs
.
Contents
The Development Environment
details required tasks to prepare a build environment and the recommended configuration of an integrated development environment (IDE).
Using FirstSpirit APIs
provides an overview of how to access FirstSpirit functionality within plug-in Java code and illustrates the primary methods to programmatically interact with the FirstSpirit client user interfaces.
Module Architecture
describes the non-code requirements for building a FirstSpirit Module using Apache Ant.
Deploying Modules
details the best-practice installation methodology of an FSM.

Examples
Examples
In order to support developers who create FirstSpirit Modules, we provide several source code packages that implement and demonstrate FirstSpirit extensions.
Instructions on building and installing these FirstSpirit modules are available in the chapter
Implementation and Deployment
.
The code and supporting files in these example packages are provided as-is for educational purposes and are not intended for use in a production environment. You are free to adapt the example code for use in project-specific implementations. As provided here, the examples are intended solely for reference, and we maintain, update and augment these examples, which may result in structural changes (e.g. module, component, package, and class naming, among other aspects) even without prior notice.
For FirstSpirit Modules (FSM) based on these example packages, update procedures are not guaranteed to succeed;
it is necessary to uninstall older versions of modules created from this code before installing a current version.
ContentCreator Examples
Name
Brief description
ContentCreator Examples
The
ContentCreator Examples Source Code Package
(Version 2025.1) contains example implementations for
ContentCreator extension types
including interactive features and management extensions.
Complex Examples
The following table lists downloadable source code packages which present more involved example implementations, usually consisting of several different FirstSpirit plug-in types working together.
Name
Brief description
Editorial Search and Replace
The
"Editorial Search and Replace" Source Code Package
(Version 2025.1) contains a complex example which demonstrates a means to combine a report plug-in with various associated plug-in types and a client-side service.
Accessing Web Services via OData/SOAP
Two source code packages contain complex examples which demonstrate how DataAccessPlugins can be created to access data provided by OData and SOAP web services, respectively.
See
the chapter
for download links of these source code packages.
Device Preview with BrowserStack
The
"BrowserStack External Preview" Source Code Package
(Version 2024.3) illustrates the use case of external preview item plug-ins, which may add executable menu items to the dropdown list associated with SiteArchitect's "Preview" button in the editorial toolbar. The items are used to access device-based live preview and screenshot services by BrowserStack (
http://www.browserstack.com
), which are loaded in a new browser tab.
Compiled FirstSpirit Module (FSM) version of the "BrowserStack External Preview" plug-in
(Version 2024.3) Updated versions of this FSM file may be obtained through
Technical Support
.
Use of this example requires an Access Key from Browserstack, and configuration occurs via project application components added to individual projects.
Note:
This plug-in provides access to functionality of BrowserStack, a third-party service provider (see
http://www.browserstack.com
). Use of the BrowserStack service requires a paid plan, and compatibility between this plug-in example and BrowserStack's service interfaces is not guaranteed. The BrowserStack-specific functionality is not subject to technical support by Crownpeak, and neither the plug-in source code nor the compiled FirstSpirit Module (FSM) is guaranteed to respect future changes to BrowserStack's API.

This chapter deals with further aspects, which are interesting for working with FirstSpirit.
The following topics are elucidated:
Generation
: Creating and delivering content in FirstSpirit is based on the “pre-generation” principle. Wherever possible, the content is not first produced on the live system at the time of the user query (live rendering), but is instead already on the FirstSpirit server (i.e. in a less time-sensitive offline mode) for what is called “Generation”.
Server-side release
: In addition to release via a workflow, all objects in FirstSpirit can be released server-side via the Access API. To do so, there are methods of defining the different release settings for an object. In this way, the specific release can be used to release additional objects dependent on the current object, such as the complete parent chain and child elements of the object to be released.
Exif data
: This page describes how to store Exif data in the Media Store.
Remote access
: FirstSpirit allows to access contents of another project from one project. This chapter lists amongst others the input components which can be configured for remote access.
Document groups
: Several independent pages can be grouped together to one unit by means of the “Document groups”. The hierarchical structure, which is defined in the Site Store for these pages, will be negated. This chapter shows possible applications and concrete application examples.
Tracking changes
: FirstSpirit provides an option for tracking changes via the FirstSpirit Access API. Access to the revision metadata is possible via certain API functions.
Input assistance
: Code completion enables all available tags, parameters and values to be shown and inserted at the insert mark on respective tab with one keystroke.
Successively, further topics will be added.

Tutorials for Template developers
In this chapter you can find exercises for developing templates.
First project
serves as an entry in the template development.
Starting point for the exercise is an “empty” project, which is to be populated with content step by step.
Workflows
: This chapter provides some examples for how to model workflows. These examples can are used for better explain structure and use of workflows.

Deployment models
Cloud / SaaS
Our Cloud/SaaS model offers you a full product that is executed and managed by Crownpeak as a service provider. There are different shapings within the model. A shaping includes FirstSpirit components as well as components that are used outside FirstSpirit and even potentially outside our Cloud (see hybrid approach).
Hybrid
Hybrid solutions offer you a link between the provision of services via the Crownpeak Cloud and an on-premises installation. You can keep your on-premises solution, but connect yourself to the cloud with some requirements, with personalization of content via FirstSpirit ICE for example. This is usually done for security reasons or when complete migration to the cloud becomes costly and time-consuming.
Hybrid solutions are possible by using FirstSpirit ICE or FirstSpirit CaaS, which are only available in SaaS operation, in conjunction with an on-premises installation.
On-Premises
In the on-premises model, all resources are installed directly on site. This model is perfect for companies that want to build their own digital ecosystem. It is highly customizable and gives you the flexibility to choose the infrastructure on which to run your application.
Each deployment model has a different user, authorization, and administrator concept.
Authorization and administrator concept
Administrative roles (SaaS)
In the SaaS environment, Crownpeak as a service provider takes over the installation, operation, and maintenance of FirstSpirit and guarantees reliable performance.
Users and access authorizations in the cloud environment are also managed by Crownpeak via an identity provider (Keycloak). The administration concept provides the role of a project administrator on the client side.
Project administrators in the SaaS environment can by default:
change their project's properties
export their projects
cleanup their projects
Administrative roles (On-Premises)
The user with the ID 1 who was automatically created when a FirstSpirit Server was installed is named
Administrator
. There is only one administrator per Server. In principle, he has got all rights for FirstSpirit Server and applications. However, this user can be blocked from accessing specific projects (“ServerManager / Project / Settings / Options / Block administrator”). He is always server administrator at the same time, this role cannot be taken away from this user (he is “super administrator”).
Server administrators
always hold all of the permissions of the administrator. The role of server administrator can only be assigned to a FirstSpirit user by the administrator or by another server administrator. There can be multiple server administrators per server.
Administrators and server administrators can for example:
create / export / import / delete new projects
create users
change the properties of all projects
define project administrators
install und uninstall editor and function components
execute special server operations
Project administrators
always hold all permissions in projects in which they have been added to the default “Administrators” group (see
Add user
).
By default, they can:
change their project's properties
export their projects
cleanup their projects
FirstSpirit is not a universal “out-of-the-box” product, but continuously developed software. New functionalities and customer suggestions are constantly integrated and realized. These constant updates can only be reflected in the documentation to a limited degree. This may result in some figures in this documentation varying from the current FirstSpirit view. Please do not be confused by this, and just follow the instructions as normal.
