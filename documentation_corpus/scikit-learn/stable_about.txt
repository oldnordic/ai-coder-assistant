History
#
This project was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by
David Cournapeau. Later that year, Matthieu Brucher started working on this project
as part of his thesis.
In 2010 Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent
Michel of INRIA took leadership of the project and made the first public
release, February the 1st 2010. Since then, several releases have appeared
following an approximately 3-month cycle, and a thriving international
community has been leading the development. As a result, INRIA holds the
copyright over the work done by people who were employed by INRIA at the
time of the contribution.
Governance

Coding Sprints
#
The scikit-learn project has a long history of
open source coding sprints

Donating to the project
#
If you are interested in donating to the project or to one of our code-sprints,
please donate via the
NumFOCUS Donations Page
.
Help us,
donate!
All donations will be handled by
NumFOCUS
, a non-profit
organization which is managed by a board of
Scipy community members
. NumFOCUS’s mission is to foster scientific
computing software, in particular in Python. As a fiscal home of scikit-learn, it
ensures that money is available when needed to keep the project funded and available
while in compliance with tax regulations.
The received donations for the scikit-learn project mostly will go towards covering
travel-expenses for code sprints, as well as towards the organization budget of the
project

Regarding the organization budget, in particular, we might use some of
the donated funds to pay for other project expenses such as DNS,
hosting or continuous integration services.

We would also like to thank
Microsoft Azure
,
CircleCl
for free CPU
time on their Continuous Integration servers, and
Anaconda Inc.
