Introspecting build steps
#
When you have an issue with a particular Python extension module or other build
target, there are a number of ways to figure out what the build system is doing
exactly. Beyond looking at the
meson.build
content for the target of
interest, these include:
Reading the generated
build.ninja
file in the build directory,
Using
meson
introspect
to learn more about build options, dependencies
and flags used for the target,
Reading
<build-dir>/meson-info/*.json
for details on discovered
dependencies, where Meson plans to install files to, etc.
These things are all available after the configure stage of the build (i.e.,
meson
setup
) has run. It is typically more effective to look at this
information, rather than running the build and reading the full build log.
For more details on this topic, see the
SciPy doc page on build introspection
.
