def setup_ai_tab(parent_widget, main_app_instance):
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Function is too long - consider breaking it down
```

#### AI Justification:

### 2. Code Quality - Low Severity

**File:** `/home/feanor/ai_coder_assistant/src/frontend/ui/data_tab_widgets.py` (Line: 95)

**Issue:** Magic number detected - consider using named constants

#### Original Code:
```python
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, 100)
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Magic number detected - consider using named constants
```

#### AI Justification:
The proposed fix aims to address the issue of a magic number in the code. Here's how it can be improved:

### Why this is Better:
Using variables or named constants for numbers instead of magic numbers provides several benefits, including increased readability, maintainability, and future-proofing your code. This approach makes your intent clearer at a glance.

#### Benefits of Named Constants
1. **Readability**: It enhances the clarity of your code by replacing hard-coded values with meaningful names.
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to these constants do not require updates across multiple places in your application, making it easier to refactor and update later.
3. **Future-Proofing**: If you need to change the value, you only have to modify it once—making bug fixes and enhancements more straightforward.

#### Example Improvement
If `links_per_page_spinbox` is a property of an object called `main_app_instance`, then instead of using a magic number like `100`, you could define it as follows:
```python
MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE = 100

# Original code with magic number
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)

# Proposed fix with named constant
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)
```

By using `MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE`, you explicitly state that `MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE` refers to the maximum number of links per page. This not only improves readability but also makes it clear what that constant represents within your context.

### Conclusion
Using named constants ensures clarity and maintainability in your code, aligning well with best practices for programming. Your proposed fix should reflect this by replacing magic numbers with meaningful variable names or constants where appropriate.

### 26. Code Quality - Low Severity

**File:** `/home/feanor/ai_coder_assistant/src/backend/services/scanner.py` (Line: 42)

**Issue:** Magic number detected - consider using named constants

#### Original Code:
```python
BYTES_PER_KB = 1024
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Magic number detected - consider using named constants
```

#### AI Justification:
The proposed fix aims to address the issue of a magic number in the code. Here's how it can be improved:

### Why this is Better:
Using variables or named constants for numbers instead of magic numbers provides several benefits, including increased readability, maintainability, and future-proofing your code. This approach makes your intent clearer at a glance.

#### Benefits of Named Constants
1. **Readability**: It enhances the clarity of your code by replacing hard-coded values with meaningful names.
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to these constants do not require updates across multiple places in your application, making it easier to refactor and update later.
3. **Future-Proofing**: If you need to change the value, you only have to modify it once—making bug fixes and enhancements more straightforward.

#### Example Improvement
If `links_per_page_spinbox` is a property of an object called `main_app_instance`, then instead of using a magic number like `100`, you could define it as follows:
```python
MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE = 100

# Original code with magic number
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)

# Proposed fix with named constant
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)
```

By using `MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE`, you explicitly state that `MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE` refers to the maximum number of links per page. This not only improves readability but also makes it clear what that constant represents within your context.

### Conclusion
Using named constants ensures clarity and maintainability in your code, aligning well with best practices for programming. Your proposed fix should reflect this by replacing magic numbers with meaningful variable names or constants where appropriate.

```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Function is too long - consider breaking it down
```

#### AI Justification:
Breaking the code into smaller functions can improve readability and maintainability. It makes it easier to identify and fix specific parts of the codebase rather than having a single monolithic function. This also aids in testing, as each function can be tested independently.

**Issue:** Magic number detected - consider using named constants

#### Original Code:
```python
name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Magic number detected - consider using named constants
```

#### AI Justification:
The proposed fix aims to address the issue of a magic number in the code. Here's how it can be improved:

### Why this is Better:
Using variables or named constants for numbers instead of magic numbers provides several benefits, including increased readability, maintainability, and future-proofing your code. This approach makes your intent clearer at a glance.

#### Benefits of Named Constants
1. **Readability**: It enhances the clarity of your code by replacing hard-coded values with meaningful names.
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to these constants do not require updates across multiple places in your application, making it easier to refactor and update later.
3. **Future-Proofing**: If you need to change the value, you only have to modify it once—making bug fixes and enhancements more straightforward.

#### Example Improvement
If `links_per_page_spinbox` is a property of an object called `main_app_instance`, then instead of using a magic number like `100`, you could define it as follows:
```python
MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE = 100

# Original code with magic number
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)

# Proposed fix with named constant
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)
```

By using `MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE`, you explicitly state that `MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE` refers to the maximum number of links per page. This not only improves readability but also makes it clear what that constant represents within your context.

### Conclusion
Using named constants ensures clarity and maintainability in your code, aligning well with best practices for programming. Your proposed fix should reflect this by replacing magic numbers with meaningful variable names or constants where appropriate.

By using `MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE`, you explicitly state that `MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE` refers to the maximum number of links per page. This not only improves readability but also makes it clear what that constant represents within your context.

### Conclusion
Using named constants ensures clarity and maintainability in your code, aligning well with best practices for programming. Your proposed fix should reflect this by replacing magic numbers with meaningful variable names or constants where appropriate.

**File:** `/home/feanor/ai_coder_assistant/src/backend/services/studio_ui.py` (Line: 36)

**Issue:** Function is too long - consider breaking it down

#### Original Code:
```python
def __init__(self, config_path=None):
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Function is too long - consider breaking it down
```

#### AI Justification:
Breaking the code into smaller functions can improve readability and maintainability. It makes it easier to identify and fix specific parts of the codebase rather than having a single monolithic function. This also aids in testing, as each function can be tested independently.

**Issue:** Magic number detected - consider using named constants

#### Original Code:
```python
DIALOG_DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 800
```

#### Proposed Fix:
```python
Could not parse issue: Magic number detected - consider using named constants
```

#### AI Justification:
The proposed fix aims to address the issue of a magic number in the code. Here's how it can be improved:

### Why this is Better:
Using variables or named constants for numbers instead of magic numbers provides several benefits, including increased readability, maintainability, and future-proofing your code. This approach makes your intent clearer at a glance.

#### Benefits of Named Constants
1. **Readability**: It enhances the clarity of your code by replacing hard-coded values with meaningful names.
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to these constants do not require updates across multiple places in your application, making it easier to refactor and update later.
3. **Future-Proofing**: If you need to change the value, you only have to modify it once—making bug fixes and enhancements more straightforward.

#### Example Improvement
If `links_per_page_spinbox` is a property of an object called `main_app_instance`, then instead of using a magic number like `100`, you could define it as follows:
```python
MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE = 100

# Original code with magic number
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)

# Proposed fix with named constant
main_app_instance.links_per_page_spinbox.setRange(1, MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE)
```

By using `MAIN_APP_INSTANCE.MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE`, you explicitly state that `MAXIMUM_LINKS_PER_PAGE` refers to the maximum number of links per page. This not only improves readability but also makes it clear what that constant represents within your context.
