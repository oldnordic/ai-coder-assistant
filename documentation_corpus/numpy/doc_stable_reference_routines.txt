#
In this chapter routine docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the routine. The examples assume that NumPy is imported with:
>>>
import
numpy
as
np
A convenient way to execute examples is the
%doctest_mode
mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
