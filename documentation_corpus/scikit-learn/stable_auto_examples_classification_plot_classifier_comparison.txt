Classifier comparison
#
A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets.
The point of this example is to illustrate the nature of decision boundaries
of different classifiers.
This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by
these examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.
Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated
linearly and the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs
might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.
The plots show training points in solid colors and testing points
semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test
set.
