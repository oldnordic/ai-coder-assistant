# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to consider not ignoring
#   .python-version, since it is useful for users to know what version
#   of Python you intended the library to be run with.
#   However, for an application, it is probably indicative of a local development
#   environment, and should be ignored.
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock
#   in version control. But in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific
#   dependencies is a concern, you may want to ignore it.
