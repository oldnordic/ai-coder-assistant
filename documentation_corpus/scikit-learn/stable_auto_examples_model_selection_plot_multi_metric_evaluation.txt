Demonstration of multi-metric evaluation on cross_val_score and GridSearchCV
#
Multiple metric parameter search can be done by setting the
scoring
parameter to a list of metric scorer names or a dict mapping the scorer names
to the scorer callables.
The scores of all the scorers are available in the
cv_results_
dict at keys
ending in
'_<scorer_name>'
(
'mean_test_precision'
,
'rank_test_precision'
, etc…)
The
best_estimator_
,
best_index_
,
best_score_
and
best_params_
correspond to the scorer (key) that is set to the
refit
attribute.
