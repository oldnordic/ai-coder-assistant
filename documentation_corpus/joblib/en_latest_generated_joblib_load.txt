¶
Reconstruct a Python object from a file persisted with joblib.dump.

User Guide

WARNING: joblib.load relies on the pickle module and can therefore
execute arbitrary Python code. It should therefore never be used
to load files from untrusted sources.
Parameters
:
filename: str, pathlib.Path, or file object.
The file object or path of the file from which to load the object
mmap_mode: {None, ‘r+’, ‘r’, ‘w+’, ‘c’}, optional
If not None, the arrays are memory-mapped from the disk. This
mode has no effect for compressed files. Note that in this
case the reconstructed object might no longer match exactly
the originally pickled object.
ensure_native_byte_order: bool, or ‘auto’, default==’auto’
If True, ensures that the byte order of the loaded arrays matches the
native byte ordering (or _endianness_) of the host system. This is not
compatible with memory-mapped arrays and using non-null
mmap_mode
parameter at the same time will raise an error. The default ‘auto’
parameter is equivalent to True if
mmap_mode
is None, else False.
Returns
:
result: any Python object
The object stored in the file.

joblib.dump
function to save an object
Notes
This function can load numpy array files saved separately during the
dump. If the mmap_mode argument is given, it is passed to np.load and
arrays are loaded as memmaps. As a consequence, the reconstructed
object might not match the original pickled object. Note that if the
file was saved with compression, the arrays cannot be memmapped.
