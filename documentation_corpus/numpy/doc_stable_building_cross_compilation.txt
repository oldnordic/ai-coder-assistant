Cross compilation
#
Cross compilation is a complex topic, we only add some hopefully helpful hints
here (for now). As of May 2023, cross-compilation based on
crossenv
is
known to work, as used (for example) in conda-forge. Cross-compilation without
crossenv
requires some manual overrides. You instruct these overrides by
passing options to
meson
setup
via
meson-python
.
All distributions that are known to successfully cross compile NumPy are using
python
-m
build
(
pypa/build
), but using
pip
for that should be
possible as well. Here are links to the NumPy “build recipes” on those
distros:
Void Linux
Nix
Conda-forge
See also
Meson’s documentation on cross compilation
to learn what options you
may need to pass to Meson to successfully cross compile.
One possible hiccup is that the build requires running a compiled executable in
order to determine the
long
double
format for the host platform. This may be
an obstacle, since it requires
crossenv
or QEMU to run the host (cross)
Python. To avoid this problem, specify the paths to the relevant directories in
your
cross file
:
[properties]
longdouble_format
=
'IEEE_DOUBLE_LE'
