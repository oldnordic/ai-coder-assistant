Isotonic regression
#
The class
IsotonicRegression
fits a non-decreasing real function to
1-dimensional data. It solves the following problem:
\[\min \sum_i w_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\]
subject to
\(\hat{y}_i \le \hat{y}_j\)
whenever
\(X_i \le X_j\)
,
where the weights
\(w_i\)
are strictly positive, and both
X
and
y
are
arbitrary real quantities.
The
increasing
parameter changes the constraint to
\(\hat{y}_i \ge \hat{y}_j\)
whenever
\(X_i \le X_j\)
. Setting it to
‘auto’ will automatically choose the constraint based on
Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient
.
IsotonicRegression
produces a series of predictions
\(\hat{y}_i\)
for the training data which are the closest to the targets
\(y\)
in terms of mean squared error. These predictions are interpolated
for predicting to unseen data. The predictions of
IsotonicRegression
thus form a function that is piecewise linear:
